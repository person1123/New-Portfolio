    I combined my love of generative art, microfiction, and board games to design a writing game where the players
    collaboratively build a situation and then each separately flesh it out into a story. I hoped that this would be a
    way for people like me who enjoy writing and stories but donâ€™t really make time for it to have a reason to do it in
    a social setting, as well as a fun board game for people who tend to like creative gaming. I adapted the idea of
    encoding words and relationships between them from Twitter bots into a set of cards with words and the relationships
    between them. These function similarly to dominoes to build a board containing the situation described by a story.
    Players then each write their interpretation of that story, share them with one another, and vote on a winner.

    This project involved lots of iteration using UX design methodologies to determine what words and kinds of words
    work well and build a balanced deck that is fun and replayable without being too large and unwieldy. I also had to
    create a visual language that would make teaching the game as easy as possible, differentiate the cards, and make
    reading the board easy given that cards are placed facing all different directions.
