    I started working on, and someday hope to finish, this game, which is a forward-scrolling space shooter where you
    play through stories written by a young child.
    As the stories get more mature, the gameplay becomes more focused on puzzles over shooting.

    I also developed promotional material for the game. I tried to highlight the game's aesthetic, from a clean modern
    standpoint that emphasizes the fact that the player is conceptually outside the world, looking in.
