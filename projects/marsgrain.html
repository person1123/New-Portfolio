<p>
    For a class, I designed branding for a hypothetical company that grows grain on Mars. I tried to draw influence from
    propaganda to tie the company's concept to the idea of humanity's journey off-planet, to make it feel like a
    movement to buy into than a company selling a product. I also mocked up a poster recruiting off-planet wheat
    farmers.
