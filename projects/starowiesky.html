<p>
    I designed a poster about the designer Franciszek Starowiesky. I tried to incorporate some of the feel of his style,
    while staying true to my own style and without looking like a knockoff or carbon copy. To do this, I kept his focus
    on muted colors, grotesque forms, and handwritten text, but used a flatter sensibility and different layout.
