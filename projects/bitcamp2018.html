    For <a href="https://2018.bit.camp">Bitcamp</a> 2018, I returned as the director of design. As a hackathon, Bitcamp
    prides itself
    on being welcoming to people with diverse interests, especially design. This year, we tried to focus in on this by
    developing "trails" - different programs or ways to participate in the hackathon for people with different areas of
    expertise. I created the <a href="https://medium.com/@bitcmp/burning-bright-with-design-trail-bf3e51fe5843">Design
        Trail</a>, and had a wonderful team, so I functioned in more of an art director role. We focused on branding
    that emphasized this trail theme.

    Our website used map-style trails to indicate progress and reinforce the idea of a trail, as well as calm landscapes
    to push the welcoming camp atmosphere of Bitcamp. We created pixel art reflecting many of the activities that occur
    at hackathons and used them throughout our branding in order to create a consistent theme and emphasize that there
    are many ways to participate.

    I came up with this concept, did the layout (except for some parts added by the development team) and animation, and
    art directed the actual background art. I then developed the background art into a motif used for all the rest of
    the promotional materials of the event. This was primarily a graphic design project of making a visual
    representation of the event that fit into the existing style guide, but also required some UX thinking to figure out
    a way to create an animation that wouldnâ€™t distract from the content but would deliver our message in an
    experiential way.
