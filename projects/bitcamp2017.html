    I was the director of design for <a href="https://2017.bit.camp">Bitcamp 2017</a>. <a href="bit.camp">Bitcamp</a> is
    the
    largest hackathon at University of Maryland, and aims to provide a friendly and creative atmosphere that encourages
    exploration. I designed the website, which was aimed at potential participants, and we wanted it to evoke the
    campfire atmosphere that differentiates it from other hackathons while showing that the organizers of the event are
    also people who love to code and make things.

    Our final site used a background with a picture of a landscape that cycled through day, night, and back to day as
    the user scrolled. The picture evokes the emotions of a camp, the time cycling demonstrates that the event is
    overnight, and the animation is a slightly flashy technical aspect that indicates that we’re tech-loving people
    without distracting from the content.

    I came up with this concept, did the layout (except for some parts added by the development team) and animation, and
    art directed the actual background art. I then developed the background art into a motif used for all the rest of
    the promotional materials of the event. This was primarily a graphic design project of making a visual
    representation of the event that fit into the existing style guide, but also required some UX thinking to figure out
    a way to create an animation that wouldn’t distract from the content but would deliver our message in an
    experiential way.
