    <a href="https://person1123.github.io/machine-learning-lesson">Decideotron 2000</a> is an attempt to teach the
    basics of machine learning, the technique that underlies many of today’s most exciting new technologies, including
    face recognition, machine translation, and perhaps most importantly, advertising tracking. It is an interactive
    webpage where the user creates their own machine learning models, walking through scenarios of increasing
    complexity, and sees how society’s biases inevitably seep into their results. Doing a simplified version of the work
    that tech creators do when making these new technologies will demystify them to the audience, and show how they are
    the product of their human creators. This project aims to become popular online and be easily shared, so that it
    could spread over social networks to expose as many people as possible to its message.
